    <h1>Sub Sandwiches Places</h1>
    <h2>Subway False Advertises</h2>
    <section class="first-section">
        <p>Subway has a good way of false advertising, they make the sandwiches look pretty and perfect but they are really not that way. Subway presents their bread as soft and smooth but in reality the bread is soggy or stale. They still make money from it though because nobody cares about subway and their quality. </p>

        </div>
        <p>In the opinion of some people Penn Station is better than subway because the quality of their sandwiches is identical to the presentation of their sandwiches in ads. Penn Station also has better prices than Subway when it comes to additional things like fries or chips. Subway charges an extra 3.78. At Penn Station if you want to add fries it only costs 1.00. Penn Station also has better bread, no buts.</p>

        <h2>Jimmy John's is For ''Rich Folks''</h2>
        <p>If you live in a poor area you can NOT afford to spend your money on a good luxurious Jimmy Johns sandwich. Jimmy Johns is a place that serves their food properly and not sloppy like Subway or Jersey Mikes. Jimmy Johns have meat and cheese and greens that are worth what they sell them for so the price reasonable. Jimmy Johns also charges 3 dollars for a large drink so don't go there if you are not getting work hours. </p>

        <div class="mayo">
        <p>If you eat mayo you are the worst person on this planet. Mayo is for people who don't blow there nose or clean their ears. The sauce is cold and snotty it just ruins the sandwich. </p>
